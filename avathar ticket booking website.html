    <p style="color: brown;">The skies above Pandora burned with a copper glow, as if the very air had been set alight
      by ancient rage. From the heart of the Ash Plains, blackened winds carried the scent of scorched earth, whispering
      of battles long past and those yet to come. Among the flickering shadows, Neytiri stood at the edge of a cliff,
      her bow lowered but her spirit aflame. She could feel the pulse of Eywa beneath her feet, faint and trembling, as
      though the planet itself was holding its breath. The Fire Clan’s warriors moved like living embers through the
      haze, their eyes reflecting both fury and grief. In that moment, she understood—the war was no longer just for
      survival, but for the soul of Pandora itself. And in the dance between fire and ash, only one truth remained:
      something must burn for something else to live.

      Would you like me to expand this into a full short story set in the Fire and Ash era of Pandora? That way, we can
      explore the new clan, the emotional stakes, and the deeper conflict.</p>
